<h3>The goal</h3>
I often see, of course buy, some new component: a different ping sensor, a new servo, that I wish to experiment with. When the package is open and I'm faced with doing something, I find that the cost of entry...
<ul>
<li>Digging out an Arduino</li>
<li>Hooking up a power supply</li>
<li>Being tethered to a notebook for debugging output</li>
</ul>
...prevents me from getting around to it.

<h3>The Project</h3>
Time to change that<br/>
<a href="img/hhucp.jpg" target="_new"><img src="img/hhucp.jpg" width="240"></a>
The HHuCP pays homage to the Electronic kits and Microprocessor trainers of the 70s, most notably the <a href="http://www.vintage-computer.com/heathkit3400.shtml">Heathkit ET-3400 Microprocessor Trainer</a>.<br/>
It's a <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html">Teensy++ 2.0</a> (Arduinish) microcontroller and some of the most generally useful components, pre-assembled with a large number of pins broken out for experimentation with different components microcontroller and some of the most generally useful components, pre-packaged with a large number of pins broken out for experimentation with different components.<br/>
Included are:
<ul>
<li>Teensy ++ 2.0</li>
<li>IR LED</li>
<li>RGB LED</li>
<li>Graphic LCD Display</li>
<li>8 Ohm Speaker</li>
<li>Reset Button</li>
<li>One Toggle Pushbutton with an LED ring (lit when on)</li>
<li>Two Momentary Pushbuttons with LED rings (lit when off)</li>
<li>IR Sensor</li>
<li>Ambient Light Sensor</li>
<li>DS 1302 Clock and EPROM</li>
<li>USB port for power, programming/debugging, or HID</li>
<li>Exposed Power, DIO, AIO, i2c pins</li>
</ul>

<h3>Some random notes:</h3>
The pushbuttons can be configured to be lit when on/off/always/never - to keep my options open, I ran them to a mini breadboard so that I could reconfigure them in hardware.<br/>

Use good/suitable wire. If one breaks off early on, bite the bullet and use different ones, you'll just have to go back and replace them later otherwise.

<h3>Experimenting and Prototyping</h3>
<a href="img/bus.jpg" target="_new"><img src="img/bus.jpg" width="120"></a>
I add in external components as needed on a breadboard and run jumpers to the external bus breakout.

<p>
<h3>Software</h3>
My <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hhucp/">Demo app</a> supports the built-in components and, along some of my own libraries used therein, is on Google code.<br/>
